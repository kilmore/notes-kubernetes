# Kubernetes Notes

Welcome to my kubernetes notes repository. One of my hero's from "back in the day" ([Brent Ozar](https://www.brentozar.com/)) said "when you learn something write a blog post. That way others can learn from you pain, and hey it's documented so you can come back to it."

Kubernetes is a wonderful, complicated, awesome, terrifying platform. This repo documents my notes, findings, trials and tribulations with Kuberenetes. This repo is really for me to have notes about what I have learned, samle code when I need it and useful for when I take my CKA and CKAD. And maybe someday when I am an adult, the source for some blog posts.

Stuff I think  is right or in the neighbor hood of right is in the table of contents below. Other "stuff" is either a work in progress, content I am unsure on or frankly haven't gotten to yet.

If you find this repository helpful, [groovy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhZYAL_7nMg)....... If you find errors, lemme know!
